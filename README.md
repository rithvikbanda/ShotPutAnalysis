# ShotPut
code
App should be able to record a video of someone doing a shotput throw and identify whether it is a glide, spin, stand etc

Will compare it to the other olympic level throws, and will offer feedback and ways to help improve the throw. Ex: keep elbow up, or switch feet when landing

Show an olympic throw in the same format (glide, spin, stand) so user knows what throw is supposed to look like. 

Identify when the act performed is not a shotput throw and give a error message

Add a tracking feature that allows them to log distance of each of their throws
