# ThrowBuddy 
AI based Shotput Pose Detection App
Can identify whether the throw is a glide, spin, stand etc
Compares it to the other olympic level throws, and offers feedback and ways to help improve the throw

In development:
Show an olympic throw in the same format (glide, spin, stand) so user knows what throw is supposed to look like. 
Add a tracking feature that allows them to log distance of each of their throws
